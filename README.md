# A Compiler Front End in C
Built to compile a **modified** version of the subset of Pascal presented in *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools* (the red dragon book).

Includes the following features:
* Recursive descent parsing
* Nested functions with standard static scoping
* Error recovery with synchronizing token sets
* Memory address computations for variables
* Complete type checking (including function parameters)
